            <p style="font-size:130%;"> <b> All of the data we obtain during the research will be anonymised. </b> <br> If you agree to take part in the research, you will complete a study that involves answering 100 quiz questions as part of an online group. You will never meet the other players, but you will be able to copy their answers if you are unsure of an answer. You will be paid individually based on how many points you score.
