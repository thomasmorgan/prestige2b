    <h1>Call for participants</h1>
    <p>
        The Cultural Evolution Group at the University of Exeter is looking for online participants for a brief psychology experiment. The only requirements
        are that you are at least 18 years old and are a fluent English
        speaker.  The task will take no more than 40 minutes** and will pay a minimum of $10, with an opportunity to win an extra $20 bonus. **PLEASE NOTE, although the task itself takes no longer than 40 minutes, you may have to wait for other people to join your group before the task begins. This usually takes no more than 10-15 minutes but we allow 1.5 hours for total completion to avoid panic.**

        Please click the "Accept HIT" button on the Amazon site
        above to begin the task.
